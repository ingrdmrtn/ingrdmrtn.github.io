Broadly i'm interested in how people think and learn differently, I approach this from an interest in understanding indivudal differences and psychiatric disorders. To do this I 


My research investigates the mechanisms underlying neural oscillations and cognitive function, particularly in psychiatric conditions. I use MEG, computational modeling, and AI-driven analysis to explore how brain networks support cognition and where they become disrupted in disorders. My work spans neuroimaging, machine learning, and computational psychiatry, with a focus on translational applications.

I'm currently a postdoc working with [Toby Wise](https://thewiselab.org/) at Kings College London, working on [computational models of learning and thinking]. Previously, I completed my PhD at UCL, with [Neil Burgess](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/space-memory) and [Rick Adams](https://www.tcplab.org/home) . My research has involved collaborations across neuroscience, AI, and psychiatry to better understand the neural basis of cognition and mental health.
